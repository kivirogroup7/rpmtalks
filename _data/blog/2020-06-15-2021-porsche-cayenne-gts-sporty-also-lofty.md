The Cayenne makes its return for the model year 2021 with a coupe version (seen for the first time in a Cayenne), manual transmission and V8 variant (over the V6 in the outgoing model). The 2021 GTS bridges it's gap ever so slightly with the Cayenne Turbo, while maintaining a respectable horsepower gap of 88 horses. Has Cayenne adopted style over substance? Is this Porsche's attempt at trying to make the Cayenne GTS a purist vehicle? Or is this catering to popular demands?

Let's find out!



### **DESIGN:**



#### *General Exterior:*

Since, the design on the regular GTS remains largely unchanged, we'll talk about the Coupe model.

The 2021 GTS offers a more aggressively sloped roofline to accentuate on the 'sportiness' of the car. Also offered is an exhaust system where the exhaust pipes exit through the center rather than the ends, which, honestly looks much better. The new GTS sits almost an inch lower than the previous model. Porsche's design team also made the wise decision of adding a darker overtone and black accents all over the car. Black rims, black tinted headlights and taillights, darker logos and shades of black thrown here and there. The bright red brake calipers definitely are an eye-catcher and  go well with the design language of the GTS. Overall, the exterior of the GTS Coupe is great! Proportional, Muscular and elegantly sporty.

#### *General Interior:*

The interior of the GTS is as plush as it is sporty.  With a dark overtone, plush alcantara suede, brushed aluminium trims. The upholstery has contrast stitching with red detailing on the black upholstery, Red GTS logo and Red seat-belts. 8-way adjustable seats are offered as standard. They better be for a car that costs this much!

### **PERFORMANCE:**

Horsepower and Torque!

The revived 4.0 litre, twin-turbocharged V8 busts out 453 horsepower and 457 lb-ft of torque paired with an 8-speed transmission, the GTS can launch from a standstill to 60 mph in just about 4.5 seconds, just under 4.2 seconds with the chrono package and can go on up till 168 mph (270 kmph)! The growl and the grunt of the V8 is back as Porsche decides to discontinue the V6. Also updated are newer, lighter and sportier exhausts which according to Porsche 'are a fitting soundtrack to the enhanced dynamics'. All we know is they sound 'PHENOMENAL'. 

The ride height is about 20 millimetres lower on the standard steel springs, lower at 30 millimetres on the optional three-chamber air suspension and is paired with Porsches Active Suspension Management System and a Torque Vectoring Plus system.

The 21" wheels are just as mesmerizing as the 390 millimetre front discs and 358 millimetre rear discs with Tungsten Carbide surfaced and optional All Ceramic calipers they encase.
