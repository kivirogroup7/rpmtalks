The Brits were done with the European supremacy over super-SUV's with the likes of the Lamborghini Urus, Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, Porsche Cayenne and the BMW X5M. Their answer?\
The ironically named 'Stealth'\
Originally, a Jaguar F-Pace SVR, then taken up by the British racing marquee 'Lister' to spice things up a bit and put Britain on the map for the fastest SUV's in the world.\
Have they done this? Or is it just a Good Ol' British Lie?\
Let's find out! RPM Style üòè



### *General Exterior*

If you'll notice, the car holds quite some semblance to the Jag F-Pace SVR, but just a little more aggressive, wild and muscular.\
On the front we get the new green accent-surrounded grille, a new Carbon-Fiber bumper with massive intakes to feed air into the engine. A front splitter, coupled with an equally massive one at the back keeps the Stealth planted, even at high speeds, in tight corners. Fitted with black ENORMOUS 23 in. forged wheels from Vossen, accented by the venomous green brake calipers, the Lister looks like it means business. 

Not only the looks, Lister has equipped the Stealth with custom dual-exit stainless-steel exhausts with carbon-fiber surrounds to ensure that the 

people are enthralled by hearing the Stealth before they set their eyes on this beast.

### *General Interior*

Sure, the Lister Stealth looks monstrous on the outside\
But does it continue it on the interior?\
Extremely well

The Lister Stealth has similar styled interior to the exterior, black with green accents and stitchings. Lister offers about 36 colours and 90 stitching options, but this is the 'standard' variant which, in my opinion, compliments the exterior perfectly. Speaking of the luxe, it should be just as cozy and a tad bit sportier than the SVR.

### *Performance*

Sure, the Stealth packs a lot of punch on the outside, but does it hold up to that on the "inside"?\
**YES**\
With a tantalizing 5.0L V8 grunting out a Devilish 666 horsepower and 649 lb ft. (881 Nm), I'd argue that anyone who says otherwise is wrong. So how did Lister pump up the SVR's 550hp, 502 lb ft engine to this monstrosity? \
Well, a set of dual-supercharger pulleys, custom intercoolers, a performance air filter system and an engine remap Lister take much pride in calling the LEMS (Lister Engine Management System)

This enables the Stealth to blaze from a standstill to 60 mph in just a hair above 3.5 seconds and plowing on forward to 195 mph putting it above the Urus and the Trackhawk, both of which achieve this in 3.6 seconds and can sprint up to 190 mph.

### *Verdict*

Priced at ¬£120,000 and a Gruesome performance capability, I don't think the Lister Stealth is, in any way, a lie. It means business and looks it. \
Just, I don't really get the name... Stealth? Far from it\
Not that anyone's complaining!
