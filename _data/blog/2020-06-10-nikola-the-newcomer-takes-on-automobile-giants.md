# Another EV Contender, Will it live up to the hype?

A couple months back, Tesla raged over the world when it announced its 'Cybertruck' bringing new blood to the 'pickup' market, more specifically the 'EV Pickup' market. Since then, companies like Ford, GM, Rivian and now Nikola have taken their share of the advantages and unveiled/teased their own EV-Pickups. 

### What is Nikola?

Nikola, a hybrid truck design company, founded in 2014 by Trevor Milton, that has recently come to light after it surpassed Ford in terms of Net Worth! On paper, according to the financial records and stock prices, considering the fact that they haven't sold a single unit in the EV, the company seems promising and their vehicle, The Badger, seems impressive. 



### The Badger, deal maker? deal breaker?

While most specs are unannounced yet, there are some basic ones that have surfaced.

The Badger will either sport a purely electric powertrain or, the company's, electric + fuel cell system. Either way, harmful emissions are nowhere in sight. The implementation of the fuel cell system and the installations still remains a 'volatile' issue. But that does not mean all bad news. The Badger is supposed to have around 600 miles of range with the dual propulsion system.

Horsepower and Torque! 

906 hp and 980 lb-ft of torque are pumped out to all 4 wheels by the dual propulsion system. This enables the Badger to launch from standstill to 62mph in just about 2.9 seconds! The Badger supposedly can also tow up to 8,000 lbs . While we're not sure if these numbers would stay up till the launch and make it to production. But it sounds promising! 

What's more promising is the fact that reservations and bookings start this month! The Founder Trevor Milton tweeted that reservation goes live on June 29th, with the launch event being held later in the year. With the reservation, not only will customers receive the Badger, but also get the Nikola World 2020 tickets before the rest of the world.

#### The interior on the Badger looks extremely futuristic and minimal due to the teal accents, linear-symmetrical design and vector elements!



From the concepts, spec-sheets and the leaks, the Nikola Badger seems like it could be a real competitor to the Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Electric and the Tesla Cybertruck. Until the actual details arrive!
