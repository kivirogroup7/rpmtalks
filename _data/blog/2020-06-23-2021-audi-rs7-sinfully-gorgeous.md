With BMW and Mercedes launching their prime sports cars, Audi wasn't very far behind. Launching the monstrously elegant RS version of the A7, The RS7. For the 2021 Model Year, Audi has updated quite some of the exterior while keeping the signature 'Audi styling'. The figures and looks promise a lot, or do they? Let's have a look, RPM style! ðŸ˜‰

### *DESIGN*

*General Exterior:*

The front of the RS7 is sleek, vectored and super aggressive. Audi's signature hexagon gaping grill that's grown MASSIVE this year, the sleek LED-Headlights with Audi's staggering technology and just the proportions and design language of the front of the RS7 make the RS7 a delight to look at. The side profile of the Sportback is just as aggressive with the sloped roofline, killer edges and those stellar, massive wheels! As aggressive as the front of the RS7 is, the rear end is equally elegant and sophisticated. With a decently angled rear hatch, full length taillights, flared bumpers, and two massive exhausts (that, thank god, aren't fake). Overall, the car strikes at the perfect balance between elegance, sophistication and aggression on the outside.

*General Interior:*

With the aggressive elegance on the outside, how does the interior keep up? Does it though? In typical Audi fashion, the RS7 gets the all-dark, piano-black interior as standard. No complaints there though. The interior is certainly not 'striking' or 'breathtaking', but is super minimal, dark and futuristic now with two 12.3" screens accentuating Audi's 'Virtual Cockpit' system. For some, the lack of physical buttons and knobs may be a turn off. But Audi has implemented the touch-screens with superior visibility and haptic feedbacks.

### *PERFORMANCE*

*Horsepower and Torque!*

The monstrous 4.0 liter twin-turbocharged V8 with a little aid from the 48 Volt electronic system, peaks at 591 horsepower and 590 pound-feet (800 Newton-Metres) of torque! Paired with the 8-speed Tiptronic transmission, the RS7 sprints from standstill to 62 mph in under 3.6 seconds! With the Dynamic option, the RS7 can lead up to a 174 mph (280 km/h) whereas the Dynamic Plus can raise the bar to 189.5 mph (305 km/h), Staggering figures for a car that can carry 5 people easily. Paired with the contrasting calipered, massive Carbon-Ceramic brakes, the RS7 can slow down just as fast as it can speed up.

The RS7 definitely lives up to it's tagline: 

Business in the front, party in the back!
